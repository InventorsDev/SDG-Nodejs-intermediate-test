# Task: ExpressJS Task API
This project is a simple ExpressJS task API that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. The API is built using ExpressJS and MongoDB for data storage.

## Expectations
## TASK 1
The project is expected to have the following API endpoints:

- Retrieve all tasks (GET _/api/tasks_)
- Create a task (POST _/api/tasks_)
- Retrieve a single task (GET _/api/tasks/:id_)
- Update a task (PATCH _/api/tasks/:id_)
- Delete a task (DELETE _/api/tasks/:id_)
- Mark task as completed (PATCH _/api/tasks/:id/completed_)

## TASK 2
 There are two question in the `controller/indes.js`. the `getMaxSum` and `uniqueChars`
 - Write a function called getMaxSum that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the given array. If the array is empty or contains only negative integers, the function should return 0. 
 The getMaxSum function takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the given array. If the array is empty or contains only negative integers, the function should return 0.
